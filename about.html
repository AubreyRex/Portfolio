	<p> Some of my favorite video games however this is not where I draw a line on things I like to do and I like to play. However difficult but fair games I like a lot hence the soulsBorne franchise. And I also enjoyed DOOM! a lot because it was a really intense game that made me focus a lot</p>

<p>I started working with HTML not to long ago so although one may call me a noob with it I prefer to think about myself as fresh and ready to intake information at fast and more raid rate than others already expreienced may have been able too.</p>

Admittedly my css skils aren't at the level they need to be but that's mostly because I haven't really had much of a chance. Should I get a larger purpose and chance to use it I'm sure that I could improve quickly at the opportunity. And I'd be able to complete whatever freaking project anybody gave me, no matter how little or how new I am with it.</p>
